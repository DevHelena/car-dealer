## About

This project is a technical test where I developed a car dealer in Next.js. I don't have much experience with Next, so I know I can improve this project a lot with in-depth studies, and I actually intend to do so.

## The Project

This project features a static screen where you select the car make and the year related to the models. When you click 'next,' you will be directed to a dynamic screen that shows the models based on your search.
